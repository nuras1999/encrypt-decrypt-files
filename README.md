# encrypt-decrypt-files
THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY.

This tool is made using pure Python.

INSTALL ALL THE REQUIRED MODULES AND PACKAGES BEFORE USE.

This tool traverses through all directories and files to rename its filenames and extentions.

When a file's extention is not correct that file cannot be opened using any software. 
Also when the filenames are changed we cannot recognize what file it is.

So this uses certain pattern to encrypt and decrypt names and extensions of files.

This is created to learn how to traverse through files, use dictionary, looping, etc.

Use encrypt file to change the name and decrypt file to bring it back. You should decrypt the same number of times you encrypted.

This can be used best when we create .exe of this Python program and execute using Social Engineering.

Use this in safe environment. Until you decrypt you can't use any files in your PC.
Using this is friend's PC may lead you to various severe problems. Use this with caution..!!

This is small program with less than 80 lines of code.

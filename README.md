> Encrypt and Decrypt all files in your PC

## Overview
- Think when you double click a python file and in 5 seconds you can't access any files like documents, videos, images,etc in your PC until you decrypt it.
- This program traverses all the folders and renames the files and its extensions using a Encrypt key. 
- A file cannot be opened unless the extension is correct. 
- So using the Decrypt file we bring back the files to its original form.
- This is to learn how to traverse through directories, manipulating textfiles, exception handling, dictionaries, looping, etc.


## Precautions
* Install all required modules and packages.
* Using this code to prank in unauthorized PC is not encouraged.
* It will lead to several severe issues if executed unknowingly. 
* **Use Decrypt file the same number of times the Encrypt file is used.**
